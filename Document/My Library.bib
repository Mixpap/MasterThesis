  abstract = {"Guiding the reader through all the stages that lead to the formation of a star such as our Sun, this is the first advanced textbook to provide students with a complete overview of star formation. It examines the underlying physical processes that govern the evolution from a molecular cloud core to a main-sequence star, and focuses on the formation of solar-mass stars. Each chapter combines theory and observation, helping readers to connect with and understand the theory behind star formation. Beginning with an explanation of the interstellar medium and molecular clouds as sites of star formation, subsequent chapters address the building of typical stars and the formation of high-mass stars, concluding with a discussion of the by-products and consequences of star formation. This is a unique, self-contained text with sufficient background information for self-study, and is ideal for students and professional researchers alike"--},

  title = {Physical {{Processes}} in the {{Interstellar Medium}}},
  abstract = {Interstellar space is filled with a dilute mixture of charged particles, atoms, molecules and dust grains, called the interstellar medium (ISM). Understanding its physical properties and dynamical behavior is of pivotal importance to many areas of astronomy and astrophysics. Galaxy formation and evolution, the formation of stars, cosmic nucleosynthesis, the origin of large complex, prebiotic molecules and the abundance, structure and growth of dust grains which constitute the fundamental building blocks of planets, all these processes are intimately coupled to the physics of the interstellar medium. However, despite its importance, its structure and evolution is still not fully understood. Observations reveal that the interstellar medium is highly turbulent, consists of different chemical phases, and is characterized by complex structure on all resolvable spatial and temporal scales. Our current numerical and theoretical models describe it as a strongly coupled system that is far from equilibrium and where the different components are intricately linked together by complex feedback loops. Describing the interstellar medium is truly a multi-scale and multi-physics problem. In these lecture notes we introduce the microphysics necessary to better understand the interstellar medium. We review the relations between large-scale and small-scale dynamics, we consider turbulence as one of the key drivers of galactic evolution, and we review the physical processes that lead to the formation of dense molecular clouds and that govern stellar birth in their interior.},

  abstract = {This chapter is concerned with the main physical processes that lead to star formation in gas that has already evolved to the molecular cloud state. Although this material is already relatively cold and dense, in general it has too much magnetic, rotational, thermal, and turbulent energy to allow collapse into low-mass stars. A number of physical processes, however, tend to dissipate these energies, or allow local collapse in spite of them, on time scales up to 107 yr. The main effects that need to be considered are heating, cooling, the role of shock waves, magnetic braking of rotation, diffusion of the magnetic field with respect to the gas, and the generation and decay of turbulence. After a review of the general properties of molecular clouds, the chapter discusses the physical processes relevant to the phase known as ``star formation'' (Table 1.1). It then discusses three important scenarios: magnetically controlled star formation, turbulence-controlled star formation, and induced star formation.},

The code provides a multi-physics, multi-algorithm modular environment particularly oriented towards the treatment of astrophysical flows in presence of discontinuities. Different hydrodynamic modules and algorithms may be independently selected to properly describe Newtonian, relativistic, MHD or relativistic MHD fluids. The modular structure exploits a general framework for integrating a system of conservation laws, built on modern Godunov-type shock-capturing schemes. Although a plethora of numerical methods has been successfully developed over the past two decades, the vast majority shares a common discretization recipe, involving three general steps: a piecewise polynomial reconstruction followed by the solution of Riemann problems at zone interfaces and a final evolution stage. We have checked and validated the code against several benchmarks available in literature. Test problems in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions are discussed.},

  abstract = {At low temperatures, the main coolant in primordial gas is molecular hydrogen, H2. Recent work has shown that primordial gas that is not collapsing gravitationally but is cooling from an initially ionized state forms hydrogen deuteride, HD, in sufficient amounts to cool the gas to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background. This extra cooling can reduce the characteristic mass for gravitational fragmentation and may cause a shift in the characteristic masses of population III stars. Motivated by the importance of the atomic and molecular data for the cosmological question, we assess several chemical and radiative processes that have hitherto been neglected: the sensitivity of the low temperature H2 cooling rate to the ratio of ortho-H2 to para-H2, the uncertainty in the low temperature cooling rate of H2 excited by collisions with H, the effects of cooling from H2 excited by collisions with H+ and e-, and the large uncertainties in the rates of several of the reactions responsible for determining the H2 fraction in the gas. We show that the most important of the neglected processes is the excitation of H2 by collisions with protons and electrons. This cools the gas more rapidly at early times, and so it forms less H2 and HD at late times. This fact, as well as several of the chemical uncertainties presented here, significantly affects the thermal evolution of the gas. We anticipate that this may lead to clear differences in future detailed 3D studies of first structure formation. Finally, we show that although the thermal evolution of the gas is in principle sensitive to the ortho-para ratio, in practice the standard assumption of a 3:1 ratio produces results that are almost indistinguishable from those produced by a more detailed treatment.
